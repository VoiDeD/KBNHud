(8/28/2013) ===\r\n\r\nhttp://i1258.photobucket.com/albums/ii532/HumanBrutality/KBNHud%20project%20pictures/introductionnew.png\r\n\r\n=== [http://code.google.com/p/kbnhud/wiki/Screenshots Click me for screenshots!] ===\r\n\r\nThe Steam group is where I'll post announcement of updates so you can better know about a new version when I put one out. \r\n\r\nIf you have suggestions, comments, complaints, etc., you can contact me by going to the steam group and leaving a comment. If you want to talk to me personally, click on \"nicolas.angelini\" in the left bar and go to my google code profile for my email. If you want to talk to the guy who gave a lot of time to help make this HUD what it is today, his email is john.razor97@gmail.com.\r\n\r\nhttp://i1258.photobucket.com/albums/ii532/HumanBrutality/KBNHud%20project%20pictures/descriptionnew.png\r\n\r\nI noticed that KNHUD, my favorite Team fortress 2 HUD was missing some stuff. I figured that it couldn't hurt to fix that with some help from BroselHUD, a similar HUD. However, the new plan for the HUD is to make it it's own thing, and not a copycat of KNHUD anymore. We can thanks Sinders and his eveHUD for most of the materials we needed to reach our goal.\r\n\r\nI started this HUD because I like to be able to use certain things without having to rely on chance. Take the Pomson or the Cow mangler. I know the mangler has 5 shots, but if I switch weapons, i lose count of how many I have.\r\n\r\nNow, chippy has rebuilt KNHUD into KNHUD 2.0, but I am personally dissatisfied with the new design, and I believe his redesign also was meant to allow for greater differentiation between hid HUD and this one, so I am keeping this HUD alive as a fix and slight restyling of the OLD KNHUD.\r\n\r\nhttp://i1258.photobucket.com/albums/ii532/HumanBrutality/KBNHud%20project%20pictures/placestogonew.png\r\n\r\nGo to wiki tab for the changelog.\r\n\r\nDownload latest version in the downloads tab, obviously. Comes with clever, yet relevant names for each edition.\r\n\r\nAlso, if there is a problem, report it in the steam group. I check comments there the most often.\r\n\r\nhttp://i1258.photobucket.com/albums/ii532/HumanBrutality/KBNHud%20project%20pictures/pleasereadnew.png\r\n\r\nIf you have a problem with the HUD, please tell us in a polite steam group comment. If you just say that it is bad and give no reasons why, you will be ignored.\r\n\r\nIf there is anything you don't like and want changed, post a comment in steam group and Quartz and I will contemplate it as a possible change or interchangeable override to be included in a future update.\r\n\r\nThanks for downloading! \r\n\r\nhttp://i1258.photobucket.com/albums/ii532/HumanBrutality/KBNHud%20project%20pictures/specialthanksnew.png\r\n\r\nThis goes to John, who helped me make the HUD what it is now.\r\n\r\nI would also like to thank Nordblum for providing us with brand new, updated screenshots.\r\n\r\nWe would like to also extend our thanks to Sinders and chippy for providing help coding 3.0.0. More thanks to Chippy for creating KNHUD, and to Sinders. eveHUD provided parts that we modded and implemented.\r\n\r\nThanks also goes to all those who joined our steam group and join our group chats to give us pointers. We want to hear from y'all. \r\n\r\nWe would also like to thank all the people who got involved in playtesting 3.0.0 in its alpha/beta stages. You helped shape the final rendition of the HUD, now all we have to do are bug fixes.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
